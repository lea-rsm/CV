Newly graduated from Makers Academy,
I am a former student at University of the Arts of London. Always being interested by code, I realized that I wanted to find a way to mix technology and art through code.
My goal would be to join a team where I can acquire new knowledges in coding and practice through different project what I have already learn during my time at Makers Academy.
I am deeply motivated and confident in my ability to learn quickly any technology.


### Skills


#### Communication
Working in the creative industry, has been a great asset for improving and refining my communication skills.
Interactions with clients helped me improve to state clear and concise ideas about the projects I worked on.
Makers Academy has also been a proof of how communication is important within teams, through leading standups and retros, TDD and 1:1 with coaches. It facilitates the resolution of lots bugs and helps overcome challenges.

#### Creativity
Passionate about anything related to creative domains, I was agreeably surprised to see how creativity is important in Coding. It is a valuable asset to find different routes to write elegant and clear code. Therefore, being able to refactor it and improving it easily. Coming from a creative field has also taught me a lot about how coding is more and more related to art, through new apps like [processing](http://processingjs.org), or VR art exhibitions, for example. And this really fascinates me.

#### Adaptability & Self-growth
Due to the variety in my studies and life experiences, I have developed skills to learn fast and efficiently to be able to quickly switch from projects to projects. And be able to focus on new demands from various companies whether it is in the fashion, design or technology industry.
Self-learning has always been a big part of my education. I believe it has also taught me to feel confident about taking risks and stepping out of my comfort zone. As well as staying enthusiast for any new knowledge I can acquire.
I am also keen of receiving any fearless feedbacks I can get. During my course at Makers Academy, I have learn that it is a very important point and it is by staying openminded and having introspection that you grow and improve.
